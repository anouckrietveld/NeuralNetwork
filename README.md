Developed a neural network from scratch for predicting complex patterns in images as part of a course project.
Implemented a feed-forward neural network using standard Python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy), without relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Designed and coded the backpropagation algorithm to optimize network parameters through gradient descent and the Adam optimizer.
Configured and trained the neural network with multiple layers and various neuron configurations to achieve high accuracy in image reconstruction tasks.
Tested the framework on synthetic and real image data, demonstrating the neural network's ability to approximate nonlinear functions effectively.
Visualized and analyzed the output of the neural network, comparing the performance of different network architectures and parameter settings.
